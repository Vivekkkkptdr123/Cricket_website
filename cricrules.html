        <h1>Cricket Rules</h1>
    </div>

    </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Players and Teams</h2>
            <p>A cricket team consists of 11 players, with one designated as the captain. Each team takes turns batting and bowling/fielding.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>The Toss</h2>
            <p>Before the match begins, a coin toss is conducted to determine which team will bat or bowl first.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>The Pitch</h2>
            <p>The playing field, known as the pitch, is typically 22 yards long and made of grass. It has wickets at each end.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Wickets</h2>
            <p>Each wicket consists of three stumps (vertical wooden posts) topped by two bails (horizontal wooden pieces). The aim of the bowling team is to hit the stumps to dismiss the batsman.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Scoring Runs</h2>
            <p>Batsmen score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets. They can also score runs by hitting boundaries (4 or 6 runs) by hitting the ball to or over the boundary ropes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Dismissals</h2>
            <p>Batsmen can be dismissed in various ways, including being bowled, caught, run out, stumped, and LBW (Leg Before Wicket).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Overs</h2>
            <p>An over consists of six legal deliveries bowled by a single bowler. The number of overs in a match depends on the format.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Fielding Restrictions</h2>
            <p>In limited-overs cricket, there are restrictions on the placement of fielders during certain phases of the game, such as powerplays.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>No Balls</h2>
            <p>A no ball is an illegal delivery by the bowler, resulting in the batting side being awarded an extra run and any runs scored off that delivery.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Wide Balls</h2>
            <p>A wide ball is a delivery that is too far from the batsman for a fair attempt to hit it. It results in the batting side being awarded an extra run.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Free Hits</h2>
            <p>In limited-overs cricket, a no-ball due to overstepping by the bowler results in a "free hit" for the batsman, meaning they cannot be dismissed except through a run-out.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Umpires</h2>
            <p>There are two on-field umpires who officiate the match, making decisions on dismissals, boundaries, and other aspects of play.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Reviews</h2>
            <p>Teams have the option to request a review of the umpire's decision using the Decision Review System (DRS) a limited number of times per innings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Spirit of Cricket</h2>
            <p>Players are expected to adhere to the "spirit of cricket," which promotes fair play, sportsmanship, and respect for opponents and officials.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Penalties</h2>
            <p>Violations of the rules can result in penalties, such as runs being awarded to the opposing team or the offending player being suspended.</p>
