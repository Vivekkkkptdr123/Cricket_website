            <p>Cricket, often dubbed as the gentleman's game, is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players on a circular field. Originating in England during the late 16th century, cricket has evolved into one of the most popular sports globally, particularly in countries like India, Australia, England, Pakistan, and the West Indies.</p>

            <p>The game is typically played in various formats, the most common being Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches. Test cricket, known for its traditional and extended format, spans over five days, allowing teams to display their skills across multiple innings. ODIs, as the name suggests, are limited to a single day, with each team facing a fixed number of overs, usually 50. T20 cricket is the shortest format, condensed into just three hours, making it fast-paced and action-packed.</p>

            <p>A cricket match involves two phases: batting and bowling/fielding. The team that wins the toss decides whether to bat or bowl first. The batting side aims to score runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of wickets, while the bowling side attempts to dismiss the batsmen and restrict the scoring. The essence of the game lies in the strategic battle between bat and ball, with tactics and skill playing crucial roles.</p>

            <p>Cricket has produced iconic players who have become household names, such as Sir Donald Bradman, Sachin Tendulkar, Sir Vivian Richards, and Shane Warne, among others. These players have not only mesmerized fans with their exceptional talent but have also left an indelible mark on the sport's history.</p>

            <p>The game's appeal extends beyond the boundary ropes, with fervent supporters forming passionate fan bases, especially during major tournaments like the ICC Cricket World Cup and the ICC T20 World Cup. These events captivate millions of viewers worldwide, showcasing the pinnacle of cricketing excellence and sparking intense rivalries between nations.</p>

            <p>In recent years, cricket has witnessed technological advancements, including the introduction of Decision Review System (DRS) and Hawk-Eye technology, which have added new dimensions to the game and enhanced its fairness.</p>

            <p>Overall, cricket's rich heritage, competitive spirit, and global appeal continue to make it a revered sport, captivating audiences across continents and generations.</p>
